## Initial plans

- [x] Do a model for a few animal QALYs
- [x] Do a model for a few animal foods
- [ ] Have a version of foodimpacts
- [ ] Do a model for some animal charities
- [-] Do a model for all ACE charities

## Plans after a bit more thinking

- Estimate a few animal QALYs & foods
  - [x] Cow
  - [x] Pigs
  - [x] Chicken
  - [x] Fish
- Estimate the value of a few animal charities, corresponding to helping the four animals above:
  - [ ] Beyond Meat (cows)
  - [ ] Something for pigs?
  - [x] Fish Welfare Initiative (fish)
  - [ ] The Humane League: Open Wings Alliance (chickens)
- Make these estimates valuable
  - [ ] Whip them into shape for the relative values project
  - [ ] Add some explanations, and send them to ACE

## Discarded plans & notes

I also considered a few other orgs, particularly from [ACE top charities](<https://animalcharityevaluators.org/donation-advice/recommended-charities/>), but discarded because they would require more work, or because they would require more assumptions. Below the orgs and reasons: 
- [-] Faunalytics: Too meta, postpone until later.
- [-] Wild Animal Initiative: Unclear what the cost-effectiveness of a wild animal intervention would be, and therefore unclear what the value of redirecting funding would be. Postpone
- [-] The Good Food Institute: $55M: too many programmes. Maybe try to get ACE to estimate a few of their more important programmes.
